2. Open the file location that you saved the GitHub Clone to.
3. Open Unity, or [download](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.18) it.
* This game uses Unity 2021.3.18f1 as this is the Unity version that the game was created with. 
* Make sure to get this Unity Version as others will not allow the game to preform as expected.
* Once this is downloaded, continue with the installation process.
4. Select the "Open" Button in the top right corner.
5. Navigate to the installed location of the GitHub Repository, and select that folder.
6. This should open the game in the Unity editor.
7. Once this is open, navigate to the top left corner of Unity, File -> Build and Run.
