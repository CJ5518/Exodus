Copyright -

The frog sprites used by the frog prefab are saved here, and are protected by copyright. 
They are owned by iStock, which is a company that buys the rights to artistic works from artists, and sells licences for others to use them.
Instead of buying a liscense to use the sprite, I cut the image out for free from the preview to use in Exodus.
This violates copyright because iStock owns the full rights to this work, and is selling a liscense for it to be used in 

"advertising, marketing, apps, websites, social networks, television and movies, 
presentations, newspapers, magazines and books, packaging and hundreds of other types of uses."

I stole the work to use in a game for free, but this could be protected under Fair use for at least 2 reasons:
1. I am using it for a non-profit educational purpose.
2. I am only using a portion of the full work. There are 2 more animation states of the sprite that are unused by me.
