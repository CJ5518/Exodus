Copyright -

The frog sprites used by the frog prefab are saved here, and are protected by copyright. 
They are owned by iStock, which is a company that buys the rights to artistic works from artists, and sells licences for others to use them.
Instead of buying a liscense to use the sprite, I cut the image out for free from the preview to use in Exodus.
This violates copyright because iStock owns the full rights to this work and I stole the work to use in a game for free, 
while iStock is selling a liscense for it to be used in 

"advertising, marketing, apps, websites, social networks, television and movies, 
presentations, newspapers, magazines and books, packaging and hundreds of other types of uses."

Willful copyright infringement can result in criminal penalties including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense-
but this is only if exodus were to get sued and lose, which is unlikely because we are not selling the game,
and also because this could be protected under Fair use for at least 2 reasons:
1. I am using it for a non-profit educational purpose.
2. I am only using a portion of the full work. There are 2 more animation states of the sprite that are unused by me.
