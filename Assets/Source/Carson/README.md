I am responsible for creating the player character

# Migrating From the Temp Player

Get the new player from PlayerSingleton.Player, returns a Player object.

Sorry to make you have to change your code, I just wanted to make sure that the temporary implementation was always temporary, I'll update the new player with some actual movement later.
